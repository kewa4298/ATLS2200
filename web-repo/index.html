      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>I am a rising Senior CS Major from North Palm Beach, FL. In my free time, whenever I am not swamped with hw,
         I like to workout and hang with my friends. I like to play basketball, and given if I am near water or even
         waves for that matter, I grew up surfing and I still love to do it now!</p>
